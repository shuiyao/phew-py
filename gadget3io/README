Some nature of each galaxy:
  - Many star particles have same IDs with each other. They all come from a single accretion. The number of particle spliting is more than twice in many cases.

galparts $GALID
  - Generate gal_$GALID.parts
  - Could be used by onegal.py

allstars.csh:
  - allstars $modelname $snapnum
    - W.A.R.N.I.N.G.: Make sure UNIT_M in allstars.c is correct
    - Generate a catalog $modelname_$snapnum.stars for all stars:
    - Columns: idx PID GID HID Mass Tmax Age
  - python allstars.py $modelname $snapstr
    - Combine the above .stars file with SFRINFO, generate an auxiliary catalog named $modelname_$snapnum.starinfo
    - Columns: Mstar, Mvir, aform, aacc, Tmax, alast
    - particle order is NOT the same but has been ranked with ID!!!!
  - python stars_by_mvir.py
    - W.A.R.N.I.N.G: the PHEW flag and the UNIT_M
    - W.A.R.N.I.N.G: The Age field is now atime.
